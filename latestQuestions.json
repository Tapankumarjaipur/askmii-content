    "question": "How do I know if a social media profile is fake ?",
    "answer": "To spot a fake social media profile, check for a stolen or stock profile picture (reverse image search it), a new account with few posts but many followers, a vague or overly dramatic bio, and suspicious links or messages asking for money or personal info. Fake accounts often have random numbers in usernames and avoid real-life photos.
